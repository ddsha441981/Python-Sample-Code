# Sets is a collections of  non repetitive elements
# Sets can't contains duplicate values
# Sets is unordered because doesn't matter which order we'll use
# There is no way to change items in sets
# In set we can't access element by using index
# We can't use list in sets because list is hashable(updatable)
# We can't use dictionary in sets because dictionary is hashable(updatable)
# We can use tuples in sets


# Important: This syntax will create an empty dictionary and not an empty set
a = {} # Called Dictionary not set
print(type(a))

# An empty set can be created using the below syntax:
b = set()
print(type(b))
